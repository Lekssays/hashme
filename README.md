# hashme
An Open-Source tool to recognize hashes' types 

# How it works?
+ For a single hash : `ruby hashme.rb`
+ For multiple hashes : `ruby hashme.rb < hashes.txt > types.txt `
+ hashes.txt ( look for hashes.txt in this repo )contains the hashes that you want to know their types.
+ types.txt contains the types of the hashes in (hashes.txt) .
